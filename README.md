# React Learnings 

This project began from zero knowledge of React, I started it from scratch. Initially, I had no experience with the library, so I learned the concepts as I applied them directly to the site. With every new feature I learned, I put it into practice in that web Site, im constantly updating it as long i am learning new things
I am corruently following the ["Learn react"](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) course on scrimba/Youtube and applying almost everything I learn
